        <h1>What is the Youth Resource App?</h1>
        <p id="a">
            The Youth Resource App (YRA) is a free resource for all Portland youth, funded by Portland Public Schools Office of Student Support Services and created by the Student Success and Health mental health advisory team along with the feedback of over 100 PPS students. The cover art was designed by a Grant HS graduate.
        </p>
        <p id="b">
            The app has information about suicide prevention;  heath and wellness; housing; food; LGBTQIA+ resources; immigrant and refugee resources and more.
        </p>

        <h1>How are the resources chosen?</h1>
        <p id="c">
            There are many amazing resources in our community not listed on this app. Resources are primarily chosen by capacity to support large numbers as well as cultural responsiveness and specific identity supports.
