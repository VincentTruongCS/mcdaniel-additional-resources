        <h1>How does SUN provide resources and support to students that need help inside or outside of school?</h1>

        <p id=a>
            SUN provides a lot of support. During a normal school year we provide a meal after school and connections to clubs and partner programs. We also provide academic support through our SUN Tutoring Center and access to food through the McDaniel SUN pantry. During the Pandemic, we have supported a lot of students and their families with bill and food assistance.
        </p>

        <h1>What is one thing that helps SUN stand out from other programs?</h1>

        <p id=b>
            SUN programs are often referred to as "full-service neighborhood hubs". We strive to serve the whole student - academically, extracurically, physically - and that's what sets us apart.
        </p>

        <h1>Is SUN available for all grades (9-12th)?</h1>

        <p id="c">
            Yes, SUN is available at all school levels.

            Food pantry update: McDaniel SUN Food Pantry is not currently located at the McDaniel at Marshall campus. It has been relocated to Jason Lee on Fridays from 2-4pm. Photo ID or proof of enrollment in a McDaniel cluster school is required. Pantry applications can be filled out in person at the McDaniel SUN Food Pantry.
        </p>

        <h1>Who should students contact?</h1>

        <p id="e">Students should contact Jack Tangel at jtangel@pps.net about tutoring and Julia Schaffner at jschaffner@pps.net about resources, partners, or club ideas!</p>
