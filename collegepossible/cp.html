        <h1>College Possible's Purpose</h1>
        <p id="a">
            College Possible’s mission is to support students who dream of earning a bachelor’s degree regardless of their household income or background. College Possible is not only a free resource for high school students, but the support carries on through college as well! It’s a great way to be a part of a community of peers who are invested in their education while also receiving individualized support. It’s so easy to be a more successful student through College Possible. It’s totally okay to not know what you want to do! College Possible is one of many resources you can utilize. Do what feels right and make sure you prioritize what matters to you.

        <h1>Activities</h1>
        <p id="b">
            Throughout the school year, students meet with a College Possible coach who recently graduated from college themselves. Coaches offer after-school sessions and 1:1 support to guide students on their path to college and answer questions about the process. Also provides frequent group sessions with their CP peers.

            Specifically for juniors, with the national curriculum, they cover college research, finances, essay writing, and ACT prep, among other things. The preparation helps juniors with their plans because it gives them confidence, clarity, training, and information when applying for college during senior year.

            Other activities include: finding summer enrichment opportunities, visiting college campuses, building community with other students who have similar college goals, etc.</p>
        <h1>Requirements</h1>
        <p id="e">
            The application is only available to juniors with a 2.5 GPA or above and who qualify for free/reduced lunch. This year, we’re still have spots open, so interested juniors can still apply this spring. If there is still room in Fall 2021, there may be an opportunity for the Class of 2022 to join College Possible.
