        <h1 class="top">Resolution No. 6251</h1>
        <h1>Resolution to change the name of Madison High School</h1>
        <h1>RECITALS</h1>
        <p id="a">
            A.  Portland Public Schools (PPS) acknowledges that the names of school buildings have a
            significant impact on the overall educational environment to foster positive student
            development and sense of belonging.
        </p>
        <p id="b">
            B.  A history of advocacy amongst students, teachers, families and staff at Madison High
            School resulted in a naming process for Madison, which identified a misalignment with
            our value and commitment to Racial Equity and Social Justice.
        </p>
        <p id="c">
            C.  At the July 14 Board of Education meeting, PPS released a plan that lays out a
            procedure for updating the Administrative Directive for renaming its buildings and other
            spaces, with Madison as a case study in the Naming and Defining Places Process.
        </p>
        <p id="d">
            D.  In September 2020, Madison High School initiated a process to recruit members to the
            renaming committee to review options for a new school name that better represents the
            culture, climate, and collective values of the school community.
        </p>
        <p id="e">
            E.  The Madison High School Naming Committee, whose membership included students,
            families, staff, community members, and alumni commenced in September 2020 and
            met until Winter 2021. The Committee completed community engagement with student
            leaders, classes, parent groups, and community groups, and tribal organizations to
            garner support for a new name option.
        </p>
        <p id="f">
            F.  The charge of the Committee work was to query the community and put forth a
            recommended name to the Superintendent for his review and final recommendation to
            the Board of Education. The Committee recommended Leodis V. McDaniel High School
            as their first choice to the Superintendent.
        </p>
        <p id="g">
            G.  Leodis V. McDaniel was a highly celebrated Portland community leader who gained an impeccable reputation as an administrator at Madison High School in the 1970s and 1980s. McDaniel was one of only a handful of Black High school principals in Oregon in the 1980s, tasked with leading Madison through desegregation through bussing.
            McDaniel embraced this challenge, as he did all of his administrative duties, with the
            singular purpose of fairness to all.
        </p>
        <p id="h">
            H.  The recommendation to rename Madison High School to Leodis V. McDaniel High
            School will help the school community continue to live their values of Community,
            Respect, Education, Equity, and Diversity (CREED).
        </p>

        <p id="i">
            I.  The Superintendent, having reviewed the process and work of the Committee,
            recommends the Board of Education renames Madison High School to Leodis V.
            McDaniel High School.
        </p>

        <h1>RESOLVED</h1>
        <p id="resolved">
            NOW, THEREFORE, Madison High School will be known as the “Leodis V. McDaniel High School”, effective immediately, with implementation beginning through Spring and Fall 2021. A brand-identity process will begin in the winter 2021 to provide visual elements. The Portland Public Schools Board of Education approves the Superintendent and school community’s final recommendation of Leodis V. McDaniel High School.
