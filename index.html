        <p>
            Step Up is an afterschool tutoring, mentoring, and leadership development program for 9th - 12th graders.  In a one-week summer leadership academy, Step Up staff challenge youth to identify their dreams and commit to working towards those goals during the school year.  Students work closely with their advocate/mentor, who engages with parents to share student progress and provide holistic support.  In addition, Step Up partners with teachers and school staff to support students’ academic growth.  At the end of the year, students receive one elective credit for participating in Step Up.
